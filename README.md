Website for attendance of vendors (PROJECT FOR INTERNSHIP)

This is a project that I have made during my internship at Tata Power. 
When I started my internship there, I noticed that the employees were keeping track of the vendors' attendance in an excel sheet. 
I found this very unproductive, so I decided to make a website (which is yet to be hosted on their server).
Until it is hosted, you can access it by using XAMPP (for windows), LAMP (for linux) and MAMP (for macOS, which I have used).
Download the files uploaded and put them in a folder called "vendor_attendance", create a database on phpMyAdmin (the attendance.sql file contains the database and table info). 
Make sure that the files are stored in applications/MAMP/htdocs. Type "http://localhost:8888/vendor_attendance/index.html" and... that's it!

You can now mark the attendance of vendors with their name, date, in-time, out-time and status.

The website is not hosted on the internet yet. It runs locally.

THANK YOU!!!
