My Project: Vendor Attendance Website

During my internship at Tata Power, I observed an inefficiency in the manual tracking of vendors’ attendance by employees using an Excel sheet. To address this, I developed a web application to streamline the process.

The website, currently in development and awaiting server hosting, is accessible through XAMPP (Windows), LAMP (Linux), and MAMP (MacOS).

Upon downloading the necessary files, create a folder named “vendor_attendance” and subsequently establish a database using phpMyAdmin. The attendance.sql file contains the database schema and table information. Ensure that the files are placed within the “Applications/MAMP/htdocs” directory.

To access the website, navigate to “http://localhost:8888/vendor_attendance/index.html.”

Upon accessing the website, users can record vendors’ attendance by providing their name, date, in-time, out-time, and status.

Please note that the website is currently in a local development stage and not accessible on the internet.

THANK YOU!!!
